<p>
A trie is a data structure for strings and can distinguish any two strings except for a same string.
The trie is used to implement an associative array.

<p>
According to <a href="crit-bit">[1](https://cr.yp.to/critbit.html)</a>.

</p>

<p>
The crit-bit trees treat a string as a binary data.
And a crit-bit is a first different bit of two binary data.
If there are two binary data a=0100 and b=0120, crit-bit is 0 in a and 1 in b at third position from head.

</p>

<p>
Define crit-bit position as a first different position of two binary data from head.
Define crit-bit as a bit at crit-bit position of a binary data.
For example, a is equal to 0100 then crit-bit position is 1(index starts from 0) and crit-bit is 1.

</p>

<p>
Define crit-bit node as a recursive data structure that has crit-bit position, left child and right child.
