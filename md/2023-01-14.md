How to install ssh client(termux) on Chromecast with Google TV(4K)
==============

UpdateDate 2023/1/14

I need small PC that can use ssh to access my development server.
Chromecast with Google TV(4K) is my solution.

However, I found no article about installing ssh client App on Chromecast.
(Because too easy?)

## CAUTION

Do not install termux from Play Store on Chromecast.
You will found `pkg install command` failed.

You have to download the latest termux apk from the internet.


## Step1. Enable developer options of Chromecast

You have to install app from unknow source. Thus authority is required.
Otherwise you cannot install termux from apk file.

1. Open setting(Top Right of Home)
2. System -> Device Information -> Android TV OS Build
3. Click 7 times

## Step2. Install APKMirror Installer(beta) on Chromecast

Open Play Store, search and install APKMirror Installer(beta).

This application support to install apk.
You can install via Play Store on Chromecast.

## Step3. Install Web Browser on Chromecast

Next, you have to download termux apk. 
However, sending file from PC or smartphoe to Chromecast is very annoying.
So, I install Sleipnir from Play Store and download termux apk directly.

## Step2. Download termux apk from web page on Chromecast

Open web browser on chromecast and search termux apk.
You will find latest termux apk easily.

Do not forget a download location of termux apk.

## Step3. Install termux

Then open APKMirror and select termx apk.
Install will start.

## Step3. Install ssh client on termux

Open termux and install ssh client.
You can choose openssh or dropbear.

```
pkg upgrade
pkg install openssh <or dropbear>
```

## Step4. ssh-keygen on termux

Generate Public-key and Private key for public key authentication.

```
ssh-keygen <your option>
```

## Step5. Send id_rsa.pub to your server

Let's send id_rsa.pub to server by any way.

I use scp by enabling password login on ssh.


```
scp -P <port> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<servername>:<save location>
```

## Step6. Write ~/.ssh/config

In order to save typing number. Use ssh config file.

```
Host <name>
  Hostname <servername>
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  Port <port>
  User <username>
```
