unar/lsar -i -indexes:
=======

I want to extract one file from zip archive.
However, when the file name contains Japanese, 
unar failed to extract one.

Thus I want to select file without file name.

By searching help and man, I found how to do this.

Both unar and lsar have `-i` option.
That speficy file by a index.

I have one question.

What is index?

THere is no explanation.
So I tested.

indexes
-----------

This `-i` option can be used like thiis.

```
lsar <file> -i <index>
unar <file> -i <index>
```

index is the number of lines appeared in `lsar` command.

If `lsar` output is like this.

```
file.zip: Zip
01.txt
02.txt
```
First line is not counted as index.
And index starts from 0.
Thus, if I add index previous output, it is like this.

```
 :file.zip: Zip
0: 01.txt
1: 02.txt
```

If you speficy index in `lsar`.
For example, `lsar file.zip -i 1`. The output is like this.

```
 :file.zip: Zip
02.txt
```

This behavior is also same in `unar`.
If you want to extract `02.txt`
Type a command like this.

```
unar file.zip -i 1
```
